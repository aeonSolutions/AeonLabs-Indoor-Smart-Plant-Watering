# Indoor Smart Plant Watering


**The Problem**

Anyone loves to have some plants nearby, even when living in an apartment building. However, few know, or have devices to do proper indoor plant care. The main culprit is the absence of water and dry soil.

Furthermore, nowadays is commonly found online, when reading the news, another case and victim of light aggression, in particular, using some kind of diode laser light: red, green, yellow, or blue. And more dangerous, ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) lasers.

**The Idea**

This Smart Indoor plant monitoring and watering is designed to be inserted into any indoor plant vase. Is able to measure and calculate the moisture content in the vase, and when detects low water contents, activates the water pump. Is able to connect to a local home server to upload indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality measurement data. This way, the owner, can have a history record database, without the need for expensive cloud subscriptions.  Additionally, it features a 6 LED system composed of an ultraviolet LED, an Infrared LED and an RGB LED, when combined with multiple devices like this one in the same room is able to perform some basic light aggression protection from an unknown light source outside during the night & day.
